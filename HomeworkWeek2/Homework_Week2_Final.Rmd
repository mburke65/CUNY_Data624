### Week 2 Assignment 

**Chapter 6 HA 6.2**



##### 6.2 The plastics data set consists of the monthly sales (in thousands) of product A for a plastics manufacturer for five years. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#preliminary EDA
plastics

```


  **a.** Plot the time series of sales of product A. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend-cycle?
    - Trend: Increasing over 1 year. Appears to be some seasonality(lag graph), length 1 year.Data is heavily seasonal.Dropping in winter and peaking in summer. Overall trend is positive.

```{r, eval=TRUE}


general.plot <- autoplot(plastics) +ggtitle("Monthly Sales of Product A") +xlab("Year") +ylab("Thousands")
seasonal.plot <-ggseasonplot(plastics, year.labels=TRUE, year.labels.left=TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Monthly Sales of Product A") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Thousands")

acf.plot <-ggAcf(plastics)+ ggtitle("Seasonality of Product A")
decomp.plot <- autoplot(stl(plastics,"periodic"))
grid.arrange(general.plot,
             seasonal.plot,
             acf.plot,
             decomp.plot,
             nrow = 2,
             top = "Sales of product A")
```


  **b.** Use a classical multiplicative decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices.

  - The multiplicative decomposition shows a general upward trend from year 2 through year 5. After year 5, the trend appears to be decreasing. The decomposition graph also displays a seasonal shift (up/down) in one year increments.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
plastics_decomp<-decompose(plastics,type="multiplicative")
head(plastics_decomp)
summary(plastics_decomp)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
plastics %>% decompose(type="multiplicative") %>%
  autoplot() + xlab("Year") +
  ggtitle("Classical multiplicative decomposition
    of Monthly Plastics Sales")
```




  **c.** Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part a?

  - Both part a and part b display a seasonal component of 1 year and a trend that is increasing over time.The decomposition shows strong seasonality in middle of year(summer). The decomposition does show a decline after year 5 because it relies on moving averages. 
  
  **d.** Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.

  - The "Adjusted Seasonal" plot shows the sales with the seasonality removed, making the upward trend is more visable. Seasonal Adjustment plot also shows that the first year sales were flat and then they grew for the next 3 years. The 5th year saw a drop in sales. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}

mult.decomposition <- plastics %>%
  decompose(type="multiplicative") %>%
  seasonal


autoplot(plastics /mult.decomposition, series = "Adjusted Seasonal")+ 
  autolayer(plastics, series = "Plastics - Normal") +
  ggtitle("Sales of Product A & Seasonally Adjusted Sales Product A")
```


**e.** Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier?

  - After 500 was added to the 35th datapoint in "plastics.adj" dataset, a large spike occurred in the middle of the data series and the seasonally adjusted data series. This can be observed in the chart below.


```{r, eval=TRUE}
plastics.adj <- plastics
plastics.adj[35] <- plastics.adj[35]+500


mult.decomposition.adj <- plastics.adj %>%
  decompose(type="multiplicative") %>%
  seasonal


autoplot(plastics.adj /mult.decomposition, series = "Adjusted Seasonal")+ 
  autolayer(plastics.adj, series = "Plastics - Normal") +
  ggtitle("Sales of Product A & Seasonally Adjusted Sales Product A (Adjusted Series [MIDDLE])")
```

**f.** Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series?

  - After 500 was added to the 60th datapoint in "plastics.adj.end" dataset, a large spike occurred at the end of the dataset. However, the seasonality seems to more closely mirror that of the original chart. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
end.series<- length(plastics)
plastics.adj.end <- plastics
plastics.adj.end[end.series] <- plastics.adj.end[end.series]+500


mult.decomposition.adj <- plastics.adj.end %>%
  decompose(type="multiplicative") %>%
  seasonal


autoplot(plastics.adj.end /mult.decomposition, series = "Adjusted Seasonal [END]")+ 
  autolayer(plastics.adj.end, series = "Plastics - Normal") +
  ggtitle("Sales of Product A & Seasonally Adjusted Sales Product A (Adjusted Series [END])")
```
